- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrmYTAD
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music, books, sports-esports.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many languages, with some of them I'm more confident, but i have basic knowledge of all of those ones: html/css/php, blueprint, c++, java, javascript (and various frameworks), python, assembly (nasm. masm, x86, x64), kotlin and more.
        with some languages i'm better, but I like learning new things, and new languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking for tips on my codes, but I'm glad even to help other programmers (as much as I can)
- 📫 How to reach me: (non professional accounts, for me is ok being contacted on personal accounts)
