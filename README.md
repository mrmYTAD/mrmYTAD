- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrmYTAD
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music, books, sports-esports.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many languages, but only things like hello world (in order to "how much I know this language": html/css, c++, java, js, python, assembly)
- 💞️ I’m looking for tips on my codes, or helping someone that is worst than me (if they exist)
- 📫 How to reach me: (non professional accounts, for me is ok being contacted on personal accounts)
